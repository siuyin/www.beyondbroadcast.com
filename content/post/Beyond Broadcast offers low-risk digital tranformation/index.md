## Summary
* Software systems start at SGD10k with SGD2.5k annual maintenance after 1st year.
* Bug-fixes and sofware extensions within initial scope *included* in first year and with annual maintenance.
* Payback within 3 to 6 months where system frees up a SGD30k a year employee.

## Indicators that you need digital assistance
You and/or your staff:  
a. Maintain a huge Excel/spreadsheet this is becoming increasingly more difficult to use.  
b. Mistakenly placed duplicate orders, leading to waste, because it has become to difficult to track manually.  
c. Want to use AI to gain a competitive advantage but don't know how or where to start.

## How are we different?
1. We believe in providing value by addressing the business need. We do this by exploring with you and your team what
you need.
1. We defining the scope of the system to address that need. As mentioned before software extentions within this scope is included. Thus we can start off with a vague concept and fine-tune it as the system evolves *without* additional charges.
1. Define the value the system will provide and how to measure that value.

## What hardware do I need?
* The computers you already have will likely be all you need to run the sofware systems. We support Windows, Mac and Linux.
* There is also a cloud option where you pay only for what you use. This has a monthly recurring cost but is usually the most reliable option to serve the sofware system.
* The *data* the systems creates and uses will need to be properly protected and backed-up. Either dedicate a computer to do this or use a cloud service. The cloud service comes with recurring monthly cost but it is the most reliable option.
* The computers you use must have an internet connection.
